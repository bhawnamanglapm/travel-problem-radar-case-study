# Changelog

Built from the git history. Dates are commit dates. The project has no version numbers or releases, so entries are
grouped by date.

## 2026-10-19

- Rewrote the README as a product case study; how-it-runs, files and rebuild steps moved to `docs/TECHNICAL.md`.
- Added `docs/PRD.md` (put together after the build), `docs/decisions.md`, this changelog and a screenshot of the
  sample digest.

## 2026-10-18

- Live daily page on Vercel (#2): a server job sweeps once a day and saves to a private Blob store; `/live/` shows
  the latest sweep read-only; `/api/data` serves only allow-listed keys. Offline tests for the sweep and data feed.
  The case study gained a "Live (updated daily)" button, and the README describes the page as not yet swept (#3).
- Working demo and honest claims (#1): the dashboard can replay a saved sample; a GitHub Pages demo; dead buttons
  fixed; unbacked claims removed or qualified; offline checks and CI; a demo screenshot; README rewritten; duplicate
  zip removed (owner approved); text files stored with LF line endings.

## 2026-08-01

- First upload: the case-study page, the dashboard component, sample data and a zip copy.
